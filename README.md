# drewberrypi

Going to just jot down everything that’s happening since I got the RaspberryPi. Everything from equipment purchased, projects that I've completed, and all the ramblings and stumblings that actually got the projects to work.
I want visibility into what I tried, how I failed, and how I fixed it. There's an art to troubleshooting, and I'll be doing a lot of it. Hopefully that means I can do it less.
